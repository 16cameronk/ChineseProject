					<h1> Story of Chinese New Year </h1>
					
					The beginning of the Chinese New Year started with a beast called the Nian. Nian would eat villagers but  the villagers would put food in front of their doors at the beginning of every year. It was believed that after the Nian ate the food they prepared, it wouldn't attack any more people. One day, a villager decided to stop  Nian. He put red paper on his house and to place firecrackers because Nian doesn't like Red. When the New Year was about to come, the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors. People also used firecrackers to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again.
